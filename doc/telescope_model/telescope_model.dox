\section telescope_intro Introduction

This document describes the format of the telescope model used by OSKAR
versions >= 2.7. The telescope model includes a description of the position of
each station in the interferometer, the configuration of each station, and a
custom element pattern for each station (if any).

\section telescope_dir Directory Structure

\subsection telescope_overview Overview

A telescope model is defined using a directory structure. The name of the
top-level directory is arbitrary, but it must contain a special file to
specify the position of each station, and a set of sub-directories (again,
with arbitrary names), one for every station. Each of these sub-directories
contains one or more special files to specify the configuration of that
station.

The \ref telescope_files "following section" shows the names of
special files allowed at each level in the directory structure.

Station directories may themselves contain further directories to describe
the configuration of sub-stations (or "tiles") that will be beamformed
hierarchically. For a two-level hierarchical station, the top station level
describes the layout of the tiles with respect to the station centre, and
files in the sub-directories describe the layout of each tile with respect
to its own centre.

The **alphabetical** order of the station directories corresponds to the order
in which the station coordinates and element data appear in the layout and
configuration files. (**Note that leading zeros must be used in directory
names when necessary.**) With one exception, there must be the same number of
directories as the number of rows in all configuration file(s) at that level.
The exception is the case where all stations (or sub-stations) are identical,
where it is sufficient to specify only one station directory: in this case,
the configuration will be copied for all stations defined in the parent layout.

\subsubsection tel_example_single_general  Example Telescope Model (single level beamforming; general case)

An example telescope model directory might contain the following:

- my_telescope_model/
  - station001/
    - [files describing the configuration of station 1]
  - station002/
    - [files describing the configuration of station 2]
  - station003/
    - [files describing the configuration of station 3]
  - [other station directories]
  - [file describing the layout of stations in the interferometer]

\subsubsection tel_example_single_identical   Example Telescope Model (single level beamforming; all stations identical)

For stations that are all identical, it is sufficient to specify only one
top-level station directory as follows:

- my_telescope_model/
  - station/
    - [files describing the configuration of all stations]
  - [file describing the layout of stations in the interferometer]

\subsubsection tel_example_hier_general Example Telescope Model (two-level beamforming; general case)

An example telescope model directory where stations are composed of tiles
could look like this:

- my_telescope_model/
  - station001/
    - tile001/
      - [files describing the configuration of tile 1 in station 1]
    - tile002/
      - [files describing the configuration of tile 2 in station 1]
    - [other tile directories]
    - [file describing the layout of tiles in station 1]
  - station002/
    - tile001/
      - [files describing the configuration of tile 1 in station 2]

    - [other tile directories]
    - [file describing the layout of tiles in station 2]
  - [other station directories]
  - [file describing the layout of stations in the interferometer]

\subsubsection tel_example_hier_identical  Example Telescope Model (two-level beamforming; all tiles and stations identical)

For hierarchical stations that are all identical, and made of identical tiles,
it is sufficient to specify only one station directory at each level:

- my_telescope_model/
  - station/
    - tile/
      - [files describing the configuration of each tile]
    - [file describing the layout of tiles in the station]
  - [file describing the layout of stations in the interferometer]

\section telescope_position Position File

The top-level "position.txt" file must specify the longitude and latitude
of the telescope origin. It must contain one line with two or three numbers:

| Column | Description                            | Comment
| ------ | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------
| 1      | WGS84 longitude, in degrees            | Required
| 2      | WGS84 latitude, in degrees             | Required
| 3      | Altitude, in metres                    | Optional (default 0.0)

\section telescope_layout_files Layout Files

Layout files contain coordinates of stations or elements at (respectively)
the telescope or station level.

\subsection telescope_layout  Telescope Level

The top-level "layout.txt" file contains a table of ASCII text to represent
station positions relative to the centre of the interferometer array.
Each line contains up to six values, which correspond to positions
represented as horizontal (x, y, z) coordinates in metres relative to a
local tangent (horizon) plane, where x is towards geographic east, y is towards
geographic north, and z is towards the local zenith. (The telescope centre
position on Earth is specified using the top-level "position.txt" file,
which is described in the above section.)

Coordinate errors can also be specified using optional columns.
The first three columns are the "measured" positions, while
the "true" positions are obtained by adding the supplied offsets to the
measured values. Coordinates are given in metres.
In order, the parameter columns are:

| Column | Description                            | Comment
| ------ | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------
| 1      | Horizontal x (east) coordinate         | Required
| 2      | Horizontal y (north) coordinate        | Required
| 3      | Horizontal z (up) coordinate           | Optional (default 0.0)
| 4      | Horizontal x (east) coordinate error   | Optional (default 0.0)
| 5      | Horizontal y (north) coordinate error  | Optional (default 0.0)
| 6      | Horizontal z (up) coordinate error     | Optional (default 0.0)

\subsubsection telescope_layout_ecef Telescope Level Earth-centred Coordinates

Many radio interferometers specify station positions in Earth-centred
coordinates. It is possible to do the same in OSKAR by using a file
named "layout_ecef.txt" instead of "layout.txt" in the top-level
telescope directory. Coordinates are given in metres.
In order, the parameter columns are:

| Column | Description                                         | Comment
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------
| 1      | ECEF x coordinate (towards longitude 0, latitude 0) | Required
| 2      | ECEF y coordinate (towards the east)                | Required
| 3      | ECEF z coordinate (towards the north pole)          | Required
| 4      | ECEF x coordinate error                             | Optional (default 0.0)
| 5      | ECEF y coordinate error                             | Optional (default 0.0)
| 6      | ECEF z coordinate error                             | Optional (default 0.0)

\subsection telescope_station_layout Station Level

In each station directory, there must be a "layout.txt" file to specify
the element position in horizontal \f$(x, y, z)\f$ coordinates relative to
the station centre, and (optionally) the \f$(x, y, z)\f$ position errors.

The format of the element layout file is the same as that used for the
telescope-level station coordinates in the horizon frame. It is not possible
to use Earth-centred coordinates to specify element locations within a station.

\note The station layouts are defined with respect to the plane of
the station platform. Use caution if the mount type of the station
platform is not 'Fixed', as these coordinates will then not correspond
to geographic directions.

\section telescope_element_types  Element Types

In each station directory, there may be optionally an "element_types.txt"
file to specify the type of each element in the station. This type index is
used in conjunction with element pattern data to select the correct file
of fitted coefficients or functional type. If the element types file is
omitted, all elements have an implicit type of 0.

In order, the parameter columns are:

| Column | Description
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------
| 1      | Element type index (must be an integer).

\section telescope_element_gain_phase_errors Element Gain & Phase Error Files

In each station directory, there may be optionally a "gain_phase.txt" file to
specify the per-element systematic and time-variable gain and phase errors.

Phases are given in degrees. In order, the parameter columns are:

| Column | Description                                                             | Comment
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------
| 1      | Systematic gain factor, \f$G_0\f$                                       | Optional (default 1.0)
| 2      | Systematic phase offset, \f$\phi_0\f$ [deg]                             | Optional (default 0.0)
| 3      | Time-variable gain factor, \f$G_{\rm std}\f$, (std. deviation)          | Optional (default 0.0)
| 4      | Time-variable phase error, \f$\phi_{\rm std}\f$, (std. deviation) [deg] | Optional (default 0.0)


Gain \f$(G_0, G_{\rm std})\f$ and phase \f$(\phi_0, \phi_{std})\f$ parameters
define a complex multiplicative factor applied to each detector element.
This complex factor is combined with the geometric beamforming weights (i.e.
weights that define the Array Factor) to give a set of weights used to
evaluate the station beam at each source direction.

As a result, the beamforming weight, \f$W\f$, for a given beam direction
\f$(\theta_b, \phi_b)\f$, detector position \f$(x,y,z)\f$ and time \f$t\f$ is
given by:

\f[
W(\theta_b, \phi_b, x, y, z, t) =
W_{\rm geometric} (\theta_b, \phi_b, x, y, z, t)
(G_0 + G_{\rm error})  \exp\left\{ i (\phi_0 + \phi_{\rm error} )\right\}
\f]

where \f$ G_{\rm error} \f$ and \f$ \phi_{\rm error} \f$ are pseudo-random
values picked, at each time-step, from Gaussian distributions with standard
deviations \f$ G_{\rm std} \f$  and \f$ \phi_{\rm std} \f$ respectively.

\section telescope_element_apodisation Element Apodisation Files

In each station directory, there may be optionally an "apodisation.txt"
(or "apodization.txt") file to specify additional complex multiplicative
beamforming weights to modify the shape of the station beam. If present,
these weights are multiplied with the DFT weights calculated for the beam
direction required at each time-step.

In order, the parameter columns are:

| Column | Description                                    | Comment
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------- | -----------------------
| 1      | Element multiplicative weight (real part)      | Optional (default 1.0)
| 2      | Element multiplicative weight (imaginary part) | Optional (default 0.0)

\latexonly
\newpage
\endlatexonly


\section telescope_element_feed_angle Element Feed Angle Files

In each station directory, there may be optionally "feed_angle.txt",
"feed_angle_x.txt" and/or "feed_angle_y.txt" files
to specify the Euler angles of the feeds of the nominal X and Y dipoles.
If only a single "feed_angle.txt" file is present, the same data are used
for both the X and Y polarisations. Note that all the angles represent
differences from zero, which is the ideal case where both dipoles are
orthogonal and in the plane of the station platform.

In order, the parameter columns are:

| Column | Description
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------
| 1      | Euler angle alpha around z-axis [deg]
| 2      | Euler angle beta around x-axis [deg]
| 3      | Euler angle gamma around z-axis [deg]

\section telescope_mount_type  Mount Type

In each station directory, there may be optionally a "mount_type.txt"
file to specify the mount type of the station platform.

Allowed types are 'Fixed' (where the elements are fixed to the
ground, as in an aperture array), 'Alt-az' (where the elements are mounted on
a platform that tracks the sky relative to the horizon) or 'Equatorial' (where
the elements are mounted on a platform that tracks the sky relative to the
equator). Only the first letter of each type is checked.

If the file is omitted, the station platform has a mount type of 'Fixed'.

In order, the parameter columns are:

| Column | Description
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------
| 1      | Station platform mount type (character: either 'A' 'E' or 'F').

\section telescope_permitted_beams Permitted Beam Directions

In each station directory, there may be optionally a "permitted_beams.txt"
file to specify a list of azimuth and elevation coordinates for all local
beam directions permitted at that station. If the file is omitted, it is
assumed that the station can form a beam anywhere on the sky. If the file is
present, then the nearest permitted direction to the computed phase centre
will be selected for each time step.

\note The permitted beam directions are defined with respect to the plane of
the station platform. Use caution if the mount type of the station
platform is not 'Fixed', as these angles will then not correspond to azimuth
and elevation in the normal sense.

In order, the parameter columns are:

| Column | Description
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------
| 1      | Azimuth coordinate of beam (local East from North) [deg]
| 2      | Elevation coordinate of beam (relative to local horizon) [deg]

\section telescope_element_patterns Element Pattern Files

\subsection telescope_element_patterns_numerical Numerical Element Patterns

Numerically-defined antenna element pattern data can be used for the
simulation. OSKAR currently supports the loading of ASCII text files produced
by the CST (Computer Simulation Technology) software package. Since
version 2.7.0, either the theta-phi or the Ludwig-3 polarisation system can
be used to represent the data. These files must contain eight columns,
in the following order:

-# Theta [deg]
-# Phi [deg]
-# Abs dir *
-# Abs theta (if theta-phi) / Abs horizontal (if Ludwig-3)
-# Phase theta [deg] (if theta-phi) / Phase horizontal [deg] (if Ludwig-3)
-# Abs phi (if theta-phi) / Abs vertical (if Ludwig-3)
-# Phase phi [deg] (if theta-phi) / Phase vertical [deg] (if Ludwig-3)
-# Ax. ratio *

(Columns marked * are ignored during the load, but must still be present.)

Ludwig-3-format data are detected by the presence of the word "Horiz" on the
first (header) line of the file; otherwise, the theta-phi system is assumed.

Since version 2.6.0, "unpolarised" (scalar) numerical element pattern data
files can be supplied, and these will be used if OSKAR is running in a scalar
or Stokes-I-only mode. Data files for scalar numerical element responses must
contain three or four columns, in the following order:

-# Theta [deg]
-# Phi [deg]
-# Amplitude
-# Phase [deg] (optional)

Before being used in the simulation, the element pattern data must be fitted
with B-splines. The fitting procedure is performed using the
<tt>oskar_fit_element_data</tt> application which is built as part of the
OSKAR package. Please see the settings file documentation for a description
of the options used by this application.

To be recognised and loaded, the fitted element data must be supplied in
files that use the following name pattern, which is created
automatically by the fitting procedure:

\verbatim
element_pattern_fit_[x|y|scalar]_<element type index>_<frequency in MHz>.bin
\endverbatim

<b>The element type index should be 0 unless there is more than one type of
element in the station</b> (as specified in the station's "element_types.txt"),
and the frequency is the frequency in MHz for which
the element pattern data are valid: so, for example,
<tt>element_pattern_fit_x_0_600.bin</tt> would contain fitted
coefficients to the data for the first type of X-dipole at 600 MHz.
The frequency nearest to the current observing frequency is used when
evaluating the response.

These files define the patterns used for the nominal X- and Y-dipoles.
The location of these files defines their scope: if placed in the top-level
directory, then they are used for all stations; if placed in a station
directory, they are used only for that station. In this way, it is possible
to specify different element patterns for each station.

\attention
Surfaces are fitted to the numerically-defined antenna data using bicubic
B-splines. Since the quality of the fit depends critically on the fitting
parameters (adjustable using the OSKAR settings file), <b>it is essential that
each fitted surface is inspected graphically to ensure that there are no
artefacts introduced by the fitting process</b>. This can be done by saving a
FITS image of the element pattern (created by evaluating the fitted
coefficients) by making an image of the station beam from a single-element
station.


\subsection telescope_element_patterns_functional Functional Element Patterns

Since version 2.7.0, functionally-defined element patterns can be specified
for a given element type, so that functional and numerical elements can be
mixed within a station.

To be recognised and loaded, the functional element data must be supplied in
files that use the following name pattern:

\verbatim
element_pattern_[x|y]_<element type index>.txt
\endverbatim

<b>The element type index should be 0 unless there is more than one type of
element in the station</b> (as specified in the station's "element_types.txt"):
so, for example, <tt>element_pattern_x_1.txt</tt> would contain the functional
pattern for the <i>second</i> type of X-dipole (and for this to actually be
used in a simulation for this example, at least one element in the station
would need to have a type index of 1 rather than 0, where type 0 represents
the default element type).

The content of the file must be a single line, which can contain
columns in the following order:

- <b>Element base type code.</b> <br>
  This is the base type of the element pattern. Currently supported type
  codes are 'I' (for isotropic) or 'D' (for dipole).
- <b>(For a dipole element) The length of the dipole.</b>
- <b>(For a dipole element) The dipole length unit code.</b><br>
  Supported type codes are 'M' for metres or 'W' for wavelengths.
- <b>Taper type code.</b><br>
  This is the type of taper applied on top of the base type. Currently
  supported type codes are 'N' (no taper; the default), 'C' (cosine)
  or 'G' (Gaussian).
- <b>(For a cosine taper) The power of the cosine.</b>
- <b>(For a Gaussian taper) The FWHM of the Gaussian, in degrees, at the
  reference frequency.</b>
- <b>(For a Gaussian taper) The reference frequency, in Hz.</b>

<b> Note that if a column is not relevant for a particular option, it must be
omitted.</b>

These files define the patterns used for the nominal X- and Y-dipoles.
The location of these files defines their scope: if placed in the top-level
directory, then they are used for all stations; if placed in a station
directory, they are used only for that station.

If no element pattern is specified for a station, the default behaviour is
to use an un-tapered half-wavelength dipole.

\subsubsection telescope_element_patterns_examples Examples

An isotropic (unpolarised) element pattern with a Gaussian FWHM taper
of 20 degrees at 100 MHz would specify <tt>I G 20.0 100e6</tt>, while a
half-wavelength dipole with a \f$\cos^{2}\f$ taper would specify
<tt>D&nbsp;0.5&nbsp;W&nbsp;C&nbsp;2.0</tt>.


\section telescope_noise System Noise Configuration Files

\subsection telescope_noise_intro Introduction

OSKAR telescope models optionally contain files, which, if present, can be used
to specify the addition of uncorrelated system noise to interferometry
simulations.

For details of how uncorrelated noise is added to interferometry simulations,
please refer to the relevant section of the OSKAR Theory of Operation document.
It should be noted that simulation settings files control the use and
selection of noise files within a telescope model. A description of these
settings can be found in the interferometry section of the OSKAR Settings
Files documentation.

\subsection telescope_noise_files Noise Files

To allow for a different level of noise to be added to each station,
telescope models can contain a number of plain text files which should be placed
either in the station folders or top-level telescope model directory.

The name and contents of each file type are described below.

\par noise_frequencies.txt
A list of frequencies, in Hz, for which noise values are defined. This file
should be situated in the root of the telescope model directory structure.

\par rms.txt
A list of noise flux density RMS values, in Jy, as a function of frequency.
The number of RMS values in the list should match the number of specified
noise frequencies. Files can be situated in the root of the telescope model
directory or in the top-level station folders. Files in station directories
allow a different RMS values to be specified per station, and files in the
root directory allow a quick way to specifying common RMS values for the
entire array.

These files take the form of a plain text file list with successive
values in the list separated by a new line. As with all of the other
OSKAR plain text format configuration files, lines starting with a hash '#'
character are treated as comments, and empty lines are ignored.
