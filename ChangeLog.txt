      Measurement Set ANTENNA table.

    * Write station directory names to the Measurement Set ANTENNA table.

      These are now specified using "position.txt" in the telescope model.

    * Made CUDA an optional dependency, and added option to specify whether
      or not to use GPUs for simulations. This makes it possible to run
      inside a virtual machine if necessary.

    * Removed Qt dependency from all command line applications, and updated

    * Restored missing settings log to beam pattern FITS headers.

2015-05-29  OSKAR-2.6.0

    * Re-wrote oskar_sim_interferometer application and changed internal
      visibility format to allow long interferometer simulations to run
      without running out of host memory. A dedicated host thread is now
      used to write visibility data, so that computation and file writes are
      overlapped as much as possible.

    * Re-wrote oskar_sim_beam_pattern application to allow use of multiple
      GPUs and to respect the maximum chunk size, so that large images can

      or as well as, FITS images.

    * Added option to select whether cross-correlations or auto-correlations,
      or both, should be calculated.

    * Contribution from the w-term was omitted from the bandwidth smearing
      calculation. This has now been fixed, so the apparent
      amplitudes of sources far from the phase centre are slightly reduced.

    * Analytical time-average smearing was calculated incorrectly
      for sources greater than 90 degrees from the phase centre.

      to specify observation length, and the ability to use various
      date formats (including MJD number and CASA-style date strings) to
      specify the start time.

    * Moved and renamed option to allow station beam duplication into
      telescope model group.

    * Added option to disable horizon clip in advanced sky model settings.
      This can save a wasted check if sources are always above the horizon.

    * Removed deprecated config.txt telescope model file loader.

    * Removed the old orientation.txt telescope model file loader.
      Replaced this with feed_angle.txt to allow for a more complete
      specification of feed angles in the future.

    * Removed options to perform explicit time averaging using multiple
      snapshots, as this was very slow.

    * Removed options to load GSM maps and HEALPix maps in K, as
      amplitude conversion to Jy was not performed correctly.

    * Removed options to write OSKAR image files, as these are deprecated.
      (Use FITS files instead.)

    * Switched to using a counter-based pseudo-random number generator
      instead of cuRAND, for increased flexibility and performance.

      storage managers. This has the additional benefit of making the CASA
      imager faster.

    * Added the ability to concatenate OSKAR visibility files for different
      observation periods into one Measurement Set as an update to the
      oskar_vis_to_ms app.

    * Added a -q option to suppress command line output log messages for many
      of the OSKAR apps.

      isotropic elements.

    * Fixed "dimension mismatch" error encountered sometimes when using
      normalised beams.

      instead of a geometric dipole.

    * Fixed a problem in the telescope model noise loader that caused it to
      incorrectly report an error in one situation.

    * Removed option to image interferometer output at end of simulation.
      (The OSKAR DFT imager is not recommended for general use.)

    * Removed element pattern fitting parameters from telescope model settings.

    * Created new application to fit element pattern data and write spline
      coefficients to a telescope model in OSKAR binary format.
      Added new settings group for this.

    * Changed element pattern fitting procedure to use Ludwig-3 coordinate
      system internally. This generally produces better quality fits for a
      given number of knots, and eliminates instability near the zenith.

    * Added the ability to specify element pattern data as a function of
      frequency. The element data closest to the current observing frequency
      is used.

    * Added the ability to specify element orientations when using
      numerical element pattern data.

      (in metres or wavelengths) as an element pattern.

    * Added option to completely normalise the centre of the station beam
      to 1.0 each time it is evaluated. This will effectively perform an
      amplitude calibration for a source at the phase centre.

    * Added option to turn off the station beam completely
      (use the "isotropic" station type for this).

    * Added scalar mode option (Stokes I only) to interferometer simulator.

    * Added UV range filter for visibility evaluation.

    * Added polarised sky model grid generator.

    * Added a reference frequency which is used to scale the FWHM of Gaussian
      beams for Gaussian beam station types.

    * Added run log and settings file to Measurement Set HISTORY table.

    * Added ability to specify a set of horizon-based permitted beam directions
      on a per-station basis.

      to the telescope model. Note, however, that the way numerical element
      pattern data is used will change considerably in future versions.

    * Fixed an issue building the Google unit test library.

    * Changed the behaviour of sky model filters to include the upper bound in
      flux, and the lower bound in radius. (Previously, both were excluded.)
