    * Removed telescope longitude, latitude and altitude from settings file.
      These are now specified using "position.txt" in the telescope model.

    * Made CUDA an optional dependency, and added option to specify whether
      or not to use GPUs for simulations. This makes it possible to run
      inside a virtual machine if necessary.

    * Removed Qt dependency from all command line applications, and updated
      the GUI to use Qt 5.

    * Changed GUI to only display settings for the selected application and to
      remember the last settings file used for each application.

    * Added option to change current working directory from GUI.

    * Removed oskar_settings_set, as it was unable to check whether settings
      were being set correctly. Settings files can now be updated using
      the --set command line option of the required application.

    * Added option to specify the number of compute devices used for
      simulations (CPU cores and/or GPU cards).

    * Added Python interface.

    * Re-wrote oskar_imager application to allow use of multiple GPUs

      Measurement Set.

    * Allowed negative source fluxes.

    * Allowed FITS images to be read if they have a diagonal CD matrix
      instead of CDELT* values.

2015-06-24  OSKAR-2.6.1

    * Changed Measurement Set WEIGHT and SIGMA columns to use a tiled storage
      manager, for an approximate 40% improvement in the write performance.

    * Restored missing settings log to beam pattern FITS headers.

2015-05-29  OSKAR-2.6.0

    * Re-wrote oskar_sim_interferometer application and changed internal
      visibility format to allow long interferometer simulations to run
      without running out of host memory. A dedicated host thread is now
      used to write visibility data, so that computation and file writes are
      overlapped as much as possible.

    * Re-wrote oskar_sim_beam_pattern application to allow use of multiple
      GPUs and to respect the maximum chunk size, so that large images can
      be made without running out of GPU memory. A dedicated host thread is now
      used to write image data, so that computation and file writes are
      overlapped as much as possible.

    * Added options to generate beam patterns for specified stations,
      or all stations in the telescope model.

    * Added option to evaluate beam patterns for specified sky model positions,
      instead of an image grid.

    * Added option to generate horizon-frame all-sky beam patterns, instead of
      using equatorial image coordinates.

    * Added options to produce time- and/or channel-averaged beam patterns.

    * Added options to produce average cross-power Stokes I beam patterns
      for selected stations.

    * Added options to save beam pattern data in plain text files instead of,
      or as well as, FITS images.

    * Added option to select whether cross-correlations or auto-correlations,
      or both, should be calculated.

    * Contribution from the w-term was omitted from the bandwidth smearing
      calculation. This has now been fixed, so the apparent
      amplitudes of sources far from the phase centre are slightly reduced.

    * Analytical time-average smearing was calculated incorrectly
      for sources greater than 90 degrees from the phase centre.
      This has now been fixed, so the apparent amplitudes of sources far
      from the phase centre are slightly reduced.

    * Fixed an issue which could result in repeated log entries.

    * Fixed time range start in Measurement Set observation table.

    * Added the ability to specify station position errors.

    * Added the ability to use numerically-defined element patterns in
      scalar mode.

    * Moved option to select polarisation mode into telescope model settings
      group, so that scalar mode can also be used for beam pattern simulations.

    * Added the ability to use seconds (as well as hours, minutes and seconds)
      to specify observation length, and the ability to use various
      date formats (including MJD number and CASA-style date strings) to
      specify the start time.

    * Moved and renamed option to allow station beam duplication into
      telescope model group.

    * Added option to disable horizon clip in advanced sky model settings.
      This can save a wasted check if sources are always above the horizon.

    * Removed deprecated config.txt telescope model file loader.

    * Removed the old orientation.txt telescope model file loader.
      Replaced this with feed_angle.txt to allow for a more complete
      specification of feed angles in the future.

    * Removed options to perform explicit time averaging using multiple
      snapshots, as this was very slow.

    * Removed options to load GSM maps and HEALPix maps in K, as
      amplitude conversion to Jy was not performed correctly.

    * Removed options to write OSKAR image files, as these are deprecated.
      (Use FITS files instead.)

    * Switched to using a counter-based pseudo-random number generator
      instead of cuRAND, for increased flexibility and performance.

    * Added CRC codes to data chunks in binary files.

    * Updated interface to oskar_settings_set binary to unset keys when the
      value is left empty.

    * Added oskar_vis_upgrade_format application to upgrade visibility files
      written by older versions of OSKAR to the new file format.

      provided by oskar_vis_summary using the --stats option.

    * Major simplification of system noise settings.

2014-09-09  OSKAR-2.5.1

    * Changed the integer range of random seeds to start at 1 (instead of 0).

    * Changed settings so that beam normalisation is on by default.

    * Further improved efficiency of Measurement Set export, using appropriate
      storage managers. This has the additional benefit of making the CASA
      imager faster.

    * Added the ability to concatenate OSKAR visibility files for different
      observation periods into one Measurement Set as an update to the
      oskar_vis_to_ms app.

    * Added a -q option to suppress command line output log messages for many
      of the OSKAR apps.

    * Fixed "out of range" error encountered when making a beam pattern with
      isotropic elements.

    * Fixed "dimension mismatch" error encountered sometimes when using
      normalised beams.

    * Fixed the scaling of uncorrelated system noise when used with the
      Stokes-I only (scalar) mode added in 2.5.0.

2014-07-22  OSKAR-2.5.0

    * Changed settings to use a half-wavelength dipole by default,
      instead of a geometric dipole.

    * Fixed a problem in the telescope model noise loader that caused it to
      incorrectly report an error in one situation.

    * Removed option to image interferometer output at end of simulation.
      (The OSKAR DFT imager is not recommended for general use.)

    * Removed element pattern fitting parameters from telescope model settings.

    * Created new application to fit element pattern data and write spline
      coefficients to a telescope model in OSKAR binary format.
      Added new settings group for this.

    * Changed element pattern fitting procedure to use Ludwig-3 coordinate
      system internally. This generally produces better quality fits for a
      given number of knots, and eliminates instability near the zenith.

    * Added the ability to specify element pattern data as a function of
      frequency. The element data closest to the current observing frequency
      is used.

    * Added the ability to specify element orientations when using
      numerical element pattern data.

    * Added the ability to specify multiple element types within a station.

      (in metres or wavelengths) as an element pattern.

    * Added option to completely normalise the centre of the station beam
      to 1.0 each time it is evaluated. This will effectively perform an
      amplitude calibration for a source at the phase centre.

    * Added option to turn off the station beam completely
      (use the "isotropic" station type for this).

    * Added scalar mode option (Stokes I only) to interferometer simulator.

    * Added UV range filter for visibility evaluation.

    * Added polarised sky model grid generator.

    * Added a reference frequency which is used to scale the FWHM of Gaussian
      beams for Gaussian beam station types.

    * Added run log and settings file to Measurement Set HISTORY table.
      (Run log will now be propagated to images made with CASA.)

    * Improved efficiency of Measurement Set export.

2014-02-25  OSKAR-2.4.0

    * Added ability to specify a set of horizon-based permitted beam directions
      on a per-station basis.

    * Added ability to save spline data for fitted element patterns back out
      to the telescope model. Note, however, that the way numerical element
      pattern data is used will change considerably in future versions.

    * Fixed an issue building the Google unit test library.

    * Changed the behaviour of sky model filters to include the upper bound in
      flux, and the lower bound in radius. (Previously, both were excluded.)

    * Added a total intensity (Stokes I auto-correlation) beam pattern output
      mode.

      positions, gain and phase values, apodisation weights and orientations
      in the telescope model.

    * Added the ability to use station positions in Earth-centred coordinates.

    * Added station type for analytical scalar JVLA dishes, based on the AIPS
      task PBCOR. (http://www.aips.nrao.edu/cgi-bin/ZXHLP2.PL?PBCOR)

    * Updated options of oskar_image_summary to give the option to display the
      settings used to create the image.

    * Fixed a bug which set the minimum flux for the random power law generator
      filter to that used for the random broken power law generator filter.

    * Updated all telescope model settings for improved clarity.

    * Updated options for writing image files.

    * The settings GUI now allows for options to be disabled based on the
      value of another option. The display of various settings has been updated
      to make use of this facility.
